The RangeSlider widget allows users to select a continuous range of values between a minimum and maximum limit. It features two draggable handles on a horizontal track, representing the start and end of the range. Users can adjust these handles to define their desired range. The RangeSlider includes properties such as min, max, and divisions to set the range bounds and intervals, while labels can display values at each handle for better clarity. The onChanged callback updates the state with the selected range values, providing real-time feedback. This widget is particularly useful for scenarios where a range of values needs to be chosen, such as filtering options or setting thresholds.
